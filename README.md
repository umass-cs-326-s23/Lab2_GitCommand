I have add more cool things to README in the my-branch 

- git init - Initialize a new local repository

- git clone <repo_url> - Copies an existing remote repository into a new folder on your machine

- git add . - Adds all files that were modified to be staged for commiting. You can do git add <file> for specific files.

- git commit -m "your message" - Commit the added changes with a short message describing the changes. If you don't use -m, Git will open up Vim to allow adding a longer message.

- git push origin <branch> - Pushes the changes to a particular branch. By default, git push should push to the main/master branch on the remote, but you can specifiy other branches as well.

- git pull - Grabs changes from the remote repo to your local one.

- git branch - Lists out all the existing branches on the local repo.

- git checkout -b <branch_name> - Creates and switches to a new branch. Remove the -b if you only want to switch to an existing branch.

- git switch <branch_name> - Another way to switch branches.

- git merge <branch_name> - Merges working branch to main/master (do this on main!). If you can, do this through GitHub so you can view all potential merge conflicts first.
